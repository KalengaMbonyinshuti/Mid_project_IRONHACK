## My midbootcamp project


Project description

The goal of this project is to predict whether individuals will accept or decline a given offer. To do this, we analyzed data on individuals who had previously accepted or declined offers and grouped them based on various features such as their average balance, the type of communication they received (letter or post code), and their risk rating (low, medium, or average).

Using this data, we built a machine learning model that predicts whether an individual is likely to accept or decline an offer based on these features. We used a variety of machine learning algorithms and evaluated their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
